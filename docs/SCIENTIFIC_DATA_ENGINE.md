# Scientific Data Engine

Phase 10 introduces the **Scientific Data Engine** â the execution layer of
Asteria Star ([`src/platform/data-engine/`](../src/platform/data-engine)). The
website is only one consumer; mobile, desktop, a public API, an SDK, AI
assistants, research and educational tools, and planetarium software all read
through the same engine. **Nothing reads raw graph files directly.**

```ts
import { engine } from "@/platform/data-engine";
const mars  = engine.entity.resolve("planet:mars");
const walk  = engine.traversal.traverse("star:sirius", { maxDepth: 2 });
const moons = engine.query.run("moons-of-jupiter");
```

## Principles

- **Pure & deterministic** â same input, same output; BFS in stable order.
- **Composable & cacheable** â small modules; entity resolution is memoized.
- **Framework-independent** â no React, no Next.js, no UI imports (enforced by
  `npm run check:arch`). Future CLI- and API-compatible.
- **No duplicated logic** â facade engines delegate to the existing subsystems;
  only the traversal and query engines add new logic.

| `skyAtlas` | Interactive sky atlas & 3D universe resolver & queries | slug → `ResolvedAtlas`; the atlas views / overlays — renders positional maps as SVG from the REAL measured RA/Dec in the star & deep-sky catalogs, and reuses the planets, moons, galaxies, exoplanets, constellations & the JWST/Hubble/Gaia facilities; no position fabricated (see [SKY_ATLAS.md](./SKY_ATLAS.md)) |
| `scientificCalculators` | Scientific calculators resolver, queries & evaluation | slug → `ResolvedCalculator`; also `compute(slug, inputs)`. 30 calculators across orbital / stellar / photometry / exoplanet / cosmology / instrument categories, each with a published formula + pure compute over CODATA 2018 & IAU 2015 constants; reuses gravitation, Kepler, Roche/Hill, the HR diagram, parallax, redshift, the transit method & the habitable zone. Every formula is validated against a known value; nothing fabricated (see [SCIENTIFIC_CALCULATORS.md](./SCIENTIFIC_CALCULATORS.md)) |

No ephemeris re-implemented, no conditions fabricated (see [OBSERVING_SUITE.md](./OBSERVING_SUITE.md)) |
| `graphExplorer` | Knowledge graph explorer resolver, queries & traversal | slug → `ResolvedGraphView`; also `statistics()`, `neighborhood(id, depth)`, `shortestPath(a, b)`, `search(q)`. Runs REAL breadth-first algorithms over the actual graph (7,000+ entities, 11,000+ relations) — live counts, degree stats, neighbourhoods, and shortest paths; every number counted, every path a real chain of relations, nothing fabricated (see [GRAPH_EXPLORER.md](./GRAPH_EXPLORER.md)) |
| `scientificAssistant` | Grounded research-assistant resolver, queries & retrieval | slug → `ResolvedAssistant`; also `explain(id)`, `compare(a, b)`, `evidenceChain(a, b)`, `related(id)`, `search(q)`. GROUNDED retrieval over the actual graph — surfaces only real facts with their provenance; no language model, nothing generated. Grounded capabilities backed today, architecture capabilities prepared for a future LLM layer (see [SCIENTIFIC_ASSISTANT.md](./SCIENTIFIC_ASSISTANT.md)) |
| `liveScientificData` | Live-data provider resolver & honest status | slug → `ResolvedLiveSource`; also `statusReport()`. Real external providers (NOAA SWPC, NASA DONKI, MPC, JPL/CNEOS, CelesTrak) modelled with the full honesty envelope; reuses the existing live-sky registry, organisations & phenomena. No provider connected in this build → no live value shown; provider keys verified real, nothing fabricated (see [LIVE_DATA.md](./LIVE_DATA.md)) |
| `webglUniverse` | 3D/Canvas universe scene resolver | slug → `ResolvedScene`; the interactive 3D scenes (Solar System to scale, distance-true stellar neighbourhood, celestial-sphere constellations) + descriptive Milky Way / Local Group. Scene geometry is built from measured coordinates by the pure `src/lib/universe-3d` projection library; a body with no measured distance is never placed distance-true, and no numeric geometry ⇒ a descriptive scene, never a fabricated one (see [UNIVERSE_3D.md](./UNIVERSE_3D.md)) |
| `researchWorkspace` | Workspace feature resolver | slug → `ResolvedWorkspaceFeature`; describes the privacy-first, local-only research workspace (saved entities, collections, notes, citation folder, exports). The workspace's data lives ONLY in the browser (src/lib/workspace); this engine only describes the capabilities. Citations reuse the citation engine; nothing is stored server-side (see [WORKSPACE.md](./WORKSPACE.md)) |
| `groundedAssistant` | Working deterministic assistant | `explain/compare/evidencePath/related/citations/learningPath` over the real graph (reuses BS retrieval, adds citation-summary & learning-path), plus the architecture-ready RAG seam (`ragPacket`, `citationForcedPrompt`, `llmStatus`). No language model is wired: `llmStatus()` reports `deterministic-grounded`/provider `null`; it returns only real facts & citations and fabricates nothing (see [GROUNDED_AI.md](./GROUNDED_AI.md)) |
| `validation` | The single validator | () â `ValidationReport[]` |

The `star` engine powers the [Star Encyclopedia](./STAR_ENCYCLOPEDIA.md) â it
resolves stars from the typed catalogue with lightweight, index-driven lookups so
it scales across thousands of pages.

## Dependency graph

```
UI / API / CLI consumers
        â  (only)
        â¼
   data-engine  ââdelegatesâââ¶ runtime Â· metadata Â· authority Â· localization
        â                      lib/{datasets,sources,citations,compare,learn,
        â¼                            timelines,discovery,media}
   knowledge-graph (entities + relations)
        â¼
   lib/sources (leaf)
```

The engine sits in the **Registry layer**; it may depend on Graph, Knowledge,
Explorer, Data, and Source â never on Presentation. Acyclic and enforced.

## Entity Resolver â example

```ts
const e = engine.entity.resolve("planet:mars");
e.name;              // "Mars"
e.relationCount;     // 4
e.quality.overall;   // "partial"
e.reviewStatus;      // "unreviewed"
e.evidenceLevels;    // ["high","moderate","limited","historical","unknown"]
```

## Graph Traversal â example

```ts
engine.traversal.traverse("space_telescope:james-webb-space-telescope", {
  maxDepth: 2, domain: "scientific",
});
// nodes reach NASA/ESA/CSA and the nebulae JWST studies, then Hubble at depth 2.
engine.traversal.path("space_telescope:james-webb-space-telescope", "planet:mars");
// JWST â NASA â Mars Science Laboratory â Mars
```

Options: `maxDepth`, `maxNodes`, `relationTypes`, `domain`
(`scientific` | `interpretive` | `mixed`). Cycle protection via a visited set;
`maxNodes` caps the walk (`truncated: true`).

## Scientific Query â honesty

Queries are derived from the live graph (no hardcoded lists). Queries that would
require measurement data the graph does not hold (brightness, distance, size,
rings, nationality) are declared in `UNSUPPORTED_QUERIES` rather than fabricated.

## Extension points

- **New query** â add a `ScientificQuery` to `QUERIES` (a `run()` that reads the
  graph). Validated for unique ids and runnability.
- **New facade** â wrap a subsystem in a new `*-engine.ts` and add it to the
  `engine` object in `index.ts`.
- Plugins register via the platform [extension points](./EXTENSIONS.md).

## Failure modes

- Unknown id â resolvers/queries return `null` (never throw).
- Traversal from an unknown start â `null`; cycles are bounded by the visited set
  and `maxNodes`.
- The validation engine returns issue lists; it never throws on data problems.

## Performance

- Entity resolution is memoized by `id@locale` (results are immutable).
- Traversal/query are O(edges visited); `maxNodes`/`maxDepth` bound the cost.
- The authority snapshot resolves quality for all entities â fine at build scale;
  memoize if the graph grows much larger.
